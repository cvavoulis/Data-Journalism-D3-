# Data Visualization with D3
In this assignment, I used d3.js to create an interactive scatter plot. I used data from the census bureau to plot the correlations between Poverty, Age, Healthcare, and Obesity. I used d3 to build the circles, axes, and axis labels. I also used tooltips to create a mouseover that contains information on each data point. The scatter plot is interactive, meaning the user can choose the x and y axis by clicking on the name of the variable wanted. Once it is clicked, d3 is used to uodate the plots.
